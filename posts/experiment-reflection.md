Based on my experiments, I have learned that my project idea is not only feasible but also holds great potential. I am thrilled with the results I achieved in a relatively short amount of time and feel inspired to delve deeper into my research. The technical foundation I established during the experiment is strong, and I am confident that with further research, I can make my application even more comprehensive and robust. The reliability of the data provided by the-odds-api has been confirmed, which is essential for the historical analysis that I plan to undertake. The experiment also highlighted some areas that I need to focus on, such as creating a user-friendly front-end and analyzing historical data. However, these findings have only motivated me further and given me a clearer sense of direction for my project. Overall, my experiments have given me valuable insights, and I am excited to continue exploring this area of research.
