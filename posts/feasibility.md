As a senior thesis, I have been working on an idea that I am passionate about. Recently, I conducted a feasibility study to determine the viability of my project, and I am pleased to report that the results were mostly positive. My idea revolves around the development of an arbitraging or hedging betting strategy for sports betting odds.

During my feasibility study, I discovered that my project is indeed feasible, although there are some possible limitations that I need to consider. For instance, my project relies heavily on the results from a historical data analysis of sports betting odds. This means that the success of my project hinges on the accuracy and reliability of the data that I use to develop my arbitraging or hedging strategy as well as the conclusions that can be drawn from this data.

Additionally, my project will be highly reliant on the-odds-api in order to access the data on sports betting odds. While I do not have much experience with this API, I am eager to learn and master this skill in order to ensure the success of my project. Furthermore, my project will require a significant amount of application development skills, which is another area that I need to improve upon.

However, despite these possible limitations, I am confident in my ability to complete this project successfully. I plan to combat these drawbacks by being willing and able to pivot if it is discovered that an arbitrage or hedging betting strategy is not viable in any way. This means that I am open to changing my approach if the data I am using or the-odds-api does not provide the necessary results. Furthermore, I will extensively research and practice using the-odds-api and application development to ensure that I am capable of working with these tools effectively.

Overall, my feasibility study has shown that my project is feasible, but there are some possible limitations that I need to consider. Nonetheless, I am confident in my ability to overcome these limitations and successfully complete my senior thesis.
